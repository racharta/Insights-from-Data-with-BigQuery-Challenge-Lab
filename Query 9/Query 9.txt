Query 9: CDGR - Cumulative Daily Growth Rate

The following query is trying to calculate the CDGR on May 10, 2020(Cumulative Daily Growth Rate) for France since the day the first case was reported. The first case was reported on Jan 24, 2020. The CDGR is calculated as:
((last_day_cases/first_day_cases)^1/days_diff)-1)
Where :
last_day_cases is the number of confirmed cases on May 10, 2020
first_day_cases is the number of confirmed cases on Feb 02, 2020
days_diff is the number of days between Feb 02 - May 10, 2020
The query isnâ€™t executing properly. Can you fix the error to make the query execute successfully?
